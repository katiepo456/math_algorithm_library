# Math/Algorithm Library

Over the course of the semester, we have implemented various mathematical equations as well as basic instructions in assembly. Continuing on this theme, we created a Mathematical/Algorithmic Library that consists of matrix operations and sorting algorithms. The inspiration for this idea stemmed from everyoneâ€™s favorite classes in college: Linear Algebra and Data Structures & Algorithms. With prior knowledge and understanding of these topics, we set out to implement these algorithms in assembly.

The Mathematical/Algorithmic Library includes the following operations:
- **Bubble Sort** is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort** is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
- **Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm where the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part; values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
- **Matrix Addition** is the operation of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together.
- **Matrix Multiplication** is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices.
